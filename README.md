# Common Graph Algorithms

## Depth-First Search (DFS):
- **description:**
  Travel as deep as we can in one direction before backtracking (so we won't stuck in an infinite loop)
- Used for topological sorting, finding connected components, and detecting cycles.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Linear Time: O(n)
  - n: number of Nodes

## Breadth-First Search (BFS):
- **description:** Traverses a graph layer by layer (start from the closest).
- Useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Linear Time: O(n)
  - n: number of Nodes

## Dynamic Programming
### Recursion + Memoization

![DP](src/DP1.png)

# Time Complexity
```
O : Time complexity
n : Input size (length , ...)

O(1) : Constant Time
i.e: return array[index]

O(log n) : Logarithmic Time
i.e: Binary search in a sorted array.

O(n) : Linear Time
i.e: Max, Min

O(n^2) : Quadratic Time
i.e: Bubble sort

O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n^2)

- For example, if you have a loop that iterates through an array of size n, the runtime would be proportional to n.
Occurance of char:
	- double loop / search functions : O(n*n)
	- hashMap : O(n)+O(n)
	- int[26] : O(k)
```
